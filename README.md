## **Game Name: Treasure Hunt**  
Treasure Hunt is a fun and challenging puzzle game where players click on grid cells to uncover hidden gems. Using color hints as clues, players must find all the gems within **30 seconds** to advance to the next level. Each level increases the difficulty by adding one more gem and expanding the grid size, while the time limit remains the same. Players earn **+10 points** for every second left on the timer. Complete all levels on time to win, but if the timer runs out on any level, it's game over!  

I chose this game because of its simple yet addictive gameplay. It offers a strategic challenge while testing quick thinking and decision-making skills, making it fun and engaging for players of all ages.
